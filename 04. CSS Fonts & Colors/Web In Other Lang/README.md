## Step 1: Create a Website in English
Start by building your website in English. Ensure all the content, titles, and text are in English initially. But in my example the dummy text (lorem ipsum..) is in latin language . I have not inuff text to add in my web so, I choose that option. After all, when build a website always first build it in English language.
